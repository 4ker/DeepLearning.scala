1. Introducing neural networks and backpropagation.
1. Introducing the computational graph representation for neural networks, and some examples written in TensorFlow.
1. Showing the interoperability issue in computational graph, including:
 Â  * Impossible to invoking Python functions from TensorFlow
   * Impossible to use Python control flow expressions from TensorFlow
   * Impossible to custom special layer in Python (requires hard-coded CUDA/C++ code)
